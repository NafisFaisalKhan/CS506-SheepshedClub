<strong>Try to take as few points as possible while still taking a trick!</strong>
<p class="tab">
    A leaster is a special round of sheepshead that occurs when no one wants to pick up the blind, indicating that no one is confident that they have a winning hand. When no one
    picks up, the dealer has the option to call either a leaster or a doubler (see the House Rules section of the
    <a href="/rules">Rules</a>
    page for more information). If you are reading this page, you must be playing a leaster!

    The goal, as stated in the title above, it to try to take as few points as possible while still taking a trick. Tricks are played like normal, with a player leading a card while
    the other players follow suit. However, there are no teams -- each player is alone. Instead of trying to take points, now you are trying to NOT take points. The dealer who called
    the leaster will also designate the trick to which the blind will go. For example, if the dealer calls the second trick and you take the second trick, the cards in the blind will
    be added to your point total at the end.

<strong>Playing the Hand</strong>
<p class="tab">
    Ideally, to win the leaster, you will take only one of the six tricks. Since the goal is to get few points, it is a good idea to not take a trick that has tens and/or aces on it, as
    you will likely lose. Instead, try to target a trick that has few points, such as one that includes several sevens, eights, or nines. Since you must follow suit, you may be forced
    to take a trick worth a lot of points -- unfortunately, there is nothing you can do in this case. However, if a fail suit is led and you do not have any cards of that fail suit, it
    is up to you if you want to play a trump card and take the trick or not. As has been discussed already, you probably only want to take it if it is worth few points. Remember, to be
    in contention for the win at the end, you must take a trick during the course of the leaster. If you don't you are automatically disqualified and will be losing one point.

<strong>Winning</strong>
<p class="tab">
    Once all six tricks have been played, each player counts up his or her points. The player that took the blind adds these to his or her total score. Whichever player has the fewest
    points wins! Each other player will then give the winner one point. Again, players that took no tricks cannot win.
