<strong>You did not pick and do not have the jack of diamonds (or other partner card).</strong>
<p class="tab">
    Your job is to make it difficult for the picking team to get the points they need to win. In most cases, you will have two other players in the same situation, so the 
    three of you form a team that opposes the picker and the partner. Remember, you will not know who the partner actually is until he or she plays the jack of diamonds,
    so you must be a bit wary when playing your cards.

<strong>Playing the Hand</strong>
<p class="tab">
    If you are not on the picking team it is probable that, between you and the other two people on your team, you do not have very many trump cards. As a result, if you
    have the opportunity to play the first card of the trick, you do NOT want to play a trump. Instead, a better lead would be a fail card that is not worth any points, such
    as the seven of hearts or the nine of clubs. If you are lucky, one of your teammates can take the trick; otherwise, you did not lose any points or power by playing that
    card. As always, remember that you
    <strong>must follow suit</strong>
    based on the first card played in the trick. This means that you might be forced to give the picking team a card that is worth a lot of points because you have no other options.
    As a rule of thumb, if you have the option to play one of two fail cards of a certain suit, play the one worth less points if the picker is taking the trick, and play the one
    worth more points if someone on your team is taking the trick.

<p class="tab">
    If the picker is guaranteed to take a trick, it is best to try to give the picker as few points as possible. However, this is not always the case. For example, assume your only
    two trump cards are the queen of spades and the ace of diamonds, and the picker has led the queen of clubs for the trick. The picker is guaranteed to take the trick, and you must
    play a trump card. The better play here would be to give the picker the ace of diamonds and save the queen. The queen of spades would be the highest card remaining, guaranteeing
    that you will take a trick later in the hand. This is good to know, as it means that the picker cannot prevent the opposing team from taking a trick, and you will lose at most two
    points instead of three.

<p class="tab">
    On the other hand, take the situation where one of the other players on the opposing team is guaranteed to take a trick. Then, it is best that you give that person points (while
    still following suit), as his or her points will be added with yours at the end. Keeping track of which players are on which team is important, as it will help you to avoid 
    making mistakes and giving points to the wrong team!

<strong>Winning</strong>
<p class="tab">
    At the end of the hand, count up the number of points that you took and combine them with the points taken by the other players not on the picking team. Often times a good benchmark
    is 30 points -- if your team can get at least 30, the worst outcome is that you only lose one point each. If your team does well and scores at least 60 points, this is great, as it
    means that you have defeated the picking team!
