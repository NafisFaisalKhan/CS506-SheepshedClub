<strong>You did not pick and do not have the jack of diamonds (or other partner card).</strong>

    Your job is to make it difficult for the picking team. Generally, you will want to hold onto your trump. If you can, it's generally a good idea to trump over
    the picker. This will let others know that you are not on the pickers team. Good cards to lead are usually fail suits that are not worth any points.

    If you know that another player is not on the picking team and that they are guaranteed to take a trick, try to give that player your card that is worth the
    most points (provided that it's not a jack or queen). Since you combine your points at the end, you want to try to take as many aces and tens as you can.
