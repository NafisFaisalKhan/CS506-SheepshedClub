<strong>You (probably) have the jack of diamonds!</strong>
<p class="tab">
    The most common way to become the partner is to have the jack of diamonds in your hand when
    <strong>someone else</strong> 
    picks up the blind. The fact that you have the jack of diamonds in your hand means that you are the picker's partner! Note that only you will know that you are the partner;
    everyone else will be guessing as to who the partner is. Do not say that you are the partner out loud either -- the only way to reveal your identity is by the cards that you play.
</p>
<p class="tab">
    Always remember: if you are dealt the jack of diamonds and you pick up the blind, 
    <strong>you are going alone!</strong>
</p>
<p class="tab">
    It is also possible that you do not have the jack of diamonds in your hand, but you are still the partner. This is the case if a person picks up the blind and the jack of diamonds
    is in the blind! The picker then receives the option to "call" the next lowest jack that he or she does not have. If you have this jack in your hand, you are the partner. Please see
    the House Rules section of the
    <a href='/rules'>Rules</a>
    page for more information about this situation.
</p>
<p class="tab">
    One other rare situation is the case when a player picks up the blind and states that they want to "go alone". This means that even though you have the jack of diamonds, you are not
    the partner because the picker believes that his or her hand is so good that he or she can win without your help. If this is the case, you join the team of players opposing the
    picker and try to help them get enough points to beat the picker!
</p>
<strong>Playing the Hand</strong>
<p class="tab">
    Your job is to help your partner get at least 61 points and win the hand! Remember, you must
    <strong>always follow suit</strong>
    , meaning that you must play a card of the same suit as the first card played (if you have one). If you get to play the first card of the trick, it is a good idea to play a trump
    card. This helps the picker out by forcing other players to play their trump, as it is likely that the picker has more trump than everyone else. If the picker is guaranteed to take
    a trick because they have played the highest card on it, it is best to give the picker as many points as you can. For example, if the picker has played the queen of clubs on a trick
    and you have the ten of diamonds in your hand, you should give it to the picker if possible, as these points go toward your combined total.
</p>
<p class="tab">
    Another way for you to help out the picker is to take fail tricks that the picker is not able to take. For example, assume that the first player led the eight of hearts. Play
    continues with players following suit (i.e. playing non-trump hearts). The picker unfortunately has a heart in his or her hand and must play it. Now you are up, and you have no
    hearts! The best thing to do here, assuming there are points in the trick, is to play a trump to take it. The jack of diamonds is a great candidate, as you will take the trick
    and the picker will now be able to trust you going forward. Alternatively, you may want to play a different trump to keep your identity a secret. Generally uncertainty regarding
    the identity of the picker can be a good thing for the picking team, however secrecy should not prevent you from playing the jack of diamonds at the right moment.
</p>
<p class="tab">
    Consider again the situation described above where hearts were led. This time, however, the picker is taking the trick with a trump. Again, you have no hearts in your hand. Since
    your team is taking the trick, instead of playing a trump, you can play any fail card you want! If you have an ace or ten, you can give those points directly to the picker, ensuring
    that your team takes them. Alternatively, you can get rid of a seven or eight of clubs or spades so that you no longer have any cards of that fail suit. Either of these plays are
    good and beneficial for your team.
</p>
<strong>Winning</strong>
<p class="tab">
    At the end of the game, combine the tricks that you took with those that the picker took and add up your points. If your team got at least 61 points, you won! Note that the picker
    will receive twice as many points as you do, as he or she took the lead and picked up the blind. For example, assume a final score of 100 to 20. Each player on the losing team
    loses one point. The picker will thus receive two points, and you will receive one. Likewise, if you won a doubler, the picker will receive four points and you will get two. Note
    that the same model applies if your team loses. Since the picking team loses double points if they lose, the picker would lose four points and you would lose two.
