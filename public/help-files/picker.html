<strong>Burying</strong>
<p>Recommendations for burying:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you have six or less trump in your hand, do not bury trump.</li>
    <li>Bury fail suits that are worth lots of points (ex. aces, tens).</li>
    <li>Remember, the cards that you bury are free points that count toward your total!</li>
</ul>
<strong>Playing the Hand</strong>
<p class="tab">
    If you get to play the first card of a trick, it is usually best to lead one of your trump. Assuming you had a good hand when you picked, chances are good that
    you have more trump in your hand than any of the other players. If you can force other players to play their trump by following suit, you can guarantee tricks for yourself
    at the end of the hand. Furthermore, it is typically not a good idea to lead trump that is worth a lot of points, such as the ace of diamonds or ten of diamonds. You want
    to do your best to make sure that you take these cards. Instead, consider leading higher trump, forcing other players to play their best cards if they want to take the trick.
    This strategy will also help you determine the identity of the partner, as a partner will usually not play a card higher than yours if you played a high one yourself (for example,
    if you played the queen of hearts, the partner would probably not play the queen of clubs unless it was his or her only remaining trump).
</p>
<p class="tab">
    Alternatively, you might not be the first person to play a card for a trick. If a player on the opposing team is playing the first card, he or she will likely play a fail card,
    such as an eight of clubs or nine of hearts, for example. Remember, in sheepshead, players must
    <strong>always follow suit!</strong>
    This means that if a player leads a heart, every player must play a heart if he or she has one in his or her hand (remember, the queen of hearts and jack of hearts do not count
    because they are trump). If a player has no hearts, he or she may play any card. If this is the case for you when you picked, you will probably want to take the trick and add the
    points to your total. To take the trick, play a trump! A queen is likely too high, so playing a jack or diamond will work well.
</p>
<p class="tab">
    Keep an eye out for the player that picks up the jack of diamonds! This person is your partner. This is good to know, as you can give points to your partner and they will count
    toward your total. If your partner is guaranteed to take a trick because they have played the highest card, give them as many points as you can! For example, assume the person
    who you know to be partner has played the queen of clubs on a trick. There are no higher cards, so he or she is guaranteed to take the trick. Remember, that you must follow suit,
    so if you have a card like the ace of diamonds or ten of diamonds, that would be a great play. On the other hand, playing a queen would not be ideal because queens are the most
    powerful cards.

<strong>Winning</strong>
<p class="tab">
    For the picker to win, he or she must take at least 61 points. Remember that any tricks taken by your partner also count toward this total. Keeping track of your point total
    after each trick that you take is a good idea -- this will let you know if you how close to this goal you are. For example, if you bury 20 points, you only need to take 41 more!
    If you have a lot of high trump you likely won't have an issue getting enough points. If you have fewer and/or weaker trump, you might want to prioritize taking tricks that are
    worth a lot of points.
</p>
<p class="tab">
    If you have a particularly good hand, you might have the chance to keep the opposing team under 30 points. If you are able to do this, that is great, as you will win double points!
    To accomplish this, you will want to do your best to stop the opposing team from taking tricks by playing cards that are more powerful than theirs. If you are really lucky, you
    may be able to keep the opposing team from taking any tricks at all, in which case you will triple points!
</p>
<p class="tab">
    Be careful though -- if you do not get at least 61 points, you will lose double points!
