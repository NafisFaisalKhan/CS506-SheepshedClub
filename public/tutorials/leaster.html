<strong>Try to take as few points as possible while still taking a trick!</strong>
<p>
    That's the idea, anyway. After the tricks have been played, the player who has taken at least one trick for the least total points will win. If you have the
    chance to take a trick that is not worth a lot of points, it's a good idea to take it with your highest trump card (maybe a queen or jack).
