<strong>You have the jack of diamonds!</strong>
<p>...(or a jack that was called)</p>
<p>Your job is to help your partner to get to at least 61 points for the win! It is up to you if you want to reveal that you are partner right away.
Generally, some uncertainty is good, but do not hesitate to play your partner card if the opportunity arises. For example, a great time to play the
jack of diamonds is when a fail suit that you do not have has been lead. As always, make sure that you follow the suit that was led.

    At the end of the game, any tricks that you have taken are added up and combined with your partners score.
