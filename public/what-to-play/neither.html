        The most important thing to remember is that if you are not leading (i.e. playing the first card of the trick), you MUST follow suit. That means that if the first card
        played was the eight of spades, you must play a spade if you have one (recall that the queen and jack of spades do not count). However, if you do not have any fail spades,
        you can play whatever you want. Due to the vast number of hand combinations possible in sheepshead, it is impossible to cover every scenario. Here we have listed some examples
        that may be similar to something that you would face during a game.

            When you are not on the picking team and you get to lead a card, you do not want to leave trump. The opposing team wants to save up its trump for tricks that it has a
            good chance of taking. Therefore, with the hand pictured above, it would be best to lead a fail card. Furthermore, you might not want to lead a fail card that is worth
            a lot of points. Instead it would be better to save the ten of spades for a later trick when you have a better chance of your team getting it. Therefore, a good lead
            would be the nine of clubs, the seven of clubs, or the nine of hearts. Based on probability, the fact that you have two fail clubs means its likelier that
            someone else on your team doesn't have a fail club, so leading a fail club would be optimal.

            Assume that these are the cards remaining in your hand. Also, assume that in one of the previous tricks the picker played a fail heart. Based on this information, the best
            card for you to play would be the nine of hearts. This is because you are hoping that hearts are the picker's "off suit", as the picker will usually only have one fail suit
            in his or her hand (unless he or she had a bad hand). Basically, of all the fail suits, hearts is the one that the picker is most likely to have remaining in his or her hand
            based on what you have seen so far.

            Assume that the cards at the left of the image are the cards that have been played on the current trick. Furthermore, assume that the picker played the queen of clubs and
            is therefore taking the trick. You must play trump in order to follow suit. In this case, the best play is the ten of diamonds. Even though this gives the picker ten points,
            it helps your team by guaranteeing that you will take at least one trick, as the queen of spades will be the highest remaining card. It is much better to give the picker
            ten points than to risk not taking any tricks and therefore paying out triple points!

        <p class="tab card">
            Assume that the picker led and played the seven of diamonds. You must play a trump card, so your options are to play the ten of diamonds (worth ten points) or play the
            eight of diamonds (worth no points). If you think about it, two of the three players that will play after you are on your team. Since the picker played a low trump, the
            odds are good that someone on your team will be able to take the trick. Therefore, it is safe to play the ten of diamonds, which, if things go well, will contribute ten
            points to your team's total.
