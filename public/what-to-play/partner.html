    The most important thing to remember is that if you are not leading (i.e. playing the first card of the trick), you MUST follow suit. That means that if the first card
    played was the eight of spades, you must play a spade if you have one (recall that the queen and jack of spades do not count). However, if you do not have any fail spades,
    you can play whatever you want. Due to the vast number of hand combinations possible in sheepshead, it is impossible to cover every scenario. Here we have listed some examples
    that may be similar to something that you would face during a game.

            When you are the partner, it is usually a good idea to lead trump. Doing so will let the picker know you are on his or her team, and will also force the opposing team
            to play their trump cards. In the hand pictured above, the seven of diamonds would be a good lead. None of your trump cards are worth a lot of points, and you can 
            most likely rely on your picker to take the trick if he or she wants to. Then you have the jack of diamonds saved for later when you might be able to take a trick with it.

            Assume that the cards at the left of the image are the cards that have been played on the current trick. Furthermore, assume that your partner played the queen of hearts
            and that someone on the opposing team played the queen of clubs. You must play a trump, so your options are either the jack of diamonds or the ten of diamonds. In this case
            you, definitely want to save the ten of diamonds because it is worth a lot of points. Therefore, you should play the jack of diamonds, even though it will reveal to the
            other players that you are the partner.

        <img src="../images/what-to-play/partner/hand3.jpg" class="long">
        <p class="tab card">
            Assume that the cards at the left of the image are the cards that have currently been played in the trick. Spades were led, and assume the picker played the king of spades.
            This means that someone on the opposing team is taking the trick, and it is worth 25 points! You do not want to let them have this trick, and you do not have any fail spades.
            Therefore, you should play one of your trump. In this situation a good play would be the ace of diamonds. It guarantees you the trick, and it is worth 11 more points that
            you can add on to the total! You could then follow it up with the jack of diamonds to force the opposing team to play their trump cards.

        <p class="tab card">
            Assume that the cards at the left of the image are the cards that have currently been played in the trick. Clubs were led, and assume the picker played the eight of diamonds.
            This means that the picker is taking the trick for your team. You do not have any clubs, so you can play whatever you want! The best play here would be the ten of spades, as
            it guarantees ten points for your team. You do not want to waste any of your trump as this trick is guaranteed for your team.
