    The most important thing to remember is that if you are not leading (i.e. playing the first card of the trick), you MUST follow suit. That means that if the first card
    played was the eight of spades, you must play a spade if you have one (recall that the queen and jack of spades do not count). However, if you do not have any fail spades,
    you can play whatever you want. Due to the vast number of hand combinations possible in sheepshead, it is impossible to cover every scenario. Here we have listed some examples
    that may be similar to something that you would face during a game.

                    A good play would be one of the queens in order to bleed out the opposing teams trump. If you play the queen of clubs, you would be guaranteed to take the trick while 
                    forcing the opposing team to burn trump. Alternatively, if you wanted to save the queen of clubs a little longer, you could play the queen of diamonds, which would 
                    likely not take the trick, but would force another player to play one of their higher queens if they wanted the trick.
