    The most important thing to remember is that if you are not leading (i.e. playing the first card of the trick), you MUST follow suit. That means that if the first card
    played was the eight of spades, you must play a spade if you have one (recall that the queen and jack of spades do not count). However, if you do not have any fail spades,
    you can play whatever you want. Due to the vast number of hand combinations possible in sheepshead, it is impossible to cover every scenario. Here we have listed some examples
    that may be similar to something that you would face during a game.

                A good play would be one of the queens in order to bleed out the opposing teams trump. If you play the queen of clubs, you would be guaranteed to take the trick while 
                forcing the opposing team to burn trump. Alternatively, if you wanted to save the queen of clubs a little longer, you could play the queen of diamonds, which would 
                likely not take the trick, but would force another player to play one of their higher queens if they wanted the trick.

                In this situation, a couple of leads are possible. You could lead the queen of clubs to try to take trump away from the opposing team. However, if you no one else plays
                a queen, you could be in trouble. Perhaps a better lead would be to play the nine of diamonds. You know that your opponents will not play any trump worth a lot of points
                because you have both the ace and ten of diamonds. Playing the nine of diamonds would force others to play trump, and perhaps your partner could help you out by
                taking the trick!

                Assume that the cards at the left of the image are the cards that have currently been played in the trick, so you are the last person to play. Hearts were led, but you
                do not have any hearts in your hand, so you can play whatever you want! The trick is already worth 21 points (one ace and one ten), so you definitely want to take it.
                To do so, you have to play a trump. The best trump to play would be the ace of diamonds, as it adds another 11 points to the trick's total to make it worth 32 points!

                Assume that the cards at the left of the image are the cards that have currently been played in the trick, so you are the last person to play. Spades were led, but you
                do not have any spades in your hand, so you can play whatever you want! Furthermore, the jack of diamonds has been played, meaning your partner is already taking the
                trick! Therefore, you do not need to play any of your trump. The best card to play here would be the nine of hearts. That way, when hearts get played later, you will
                be able to play one of your trump cards to take the trick.
