                  Hello and welcome to the sheepshead club at UW Madison! We've been a club at this university for
                  a few years now and we hope to continue for many more years to come! Playing sheepshead is a fun, social, and
                  relaxing (yet still competitive) game that anyone can learn how to play with a little help! 
                  If you're new to the game, you'll definitely want to check out our rules and help tab to learn more on
                  how to play! Otherwise if you're still not getting it, come to one of our club meetings or reach out to
                  one of our officers and we can provide you with the help you need!
