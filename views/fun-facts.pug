            | The origin of sheepshead dates back to the early nineteenth century in Germany. Originally known as Schafkopf, the game became incredibly popular.
            | When German immigrants came to the United States, they brought the game with them; sheepshead is most commonly played in Wisconsin due to the large number of
            | German immigrants that settled in the state. To this day, Schafkopf is popular in both Germany and Wisconsin -- in fact, it is the national card game of Bavaria!
            | Furthermore, Milwaukee's German Fest features daily tournaments for the duration of the festival. This stands as a testament to the enjoyable nature of the game;
            | it is popular among both young and old generations.
          p.tab
            | Many people wonder about why the game is called "sheepshead". There are two common theories about this. The first idea is that shepherds in Bavaria enjoyed playing
            | Schafkopf; when they kept track of the score, they would do so by tracing out the head of a sheep. Whoever traced the head first would win the game. The other theory
            | is that the name of the game, Schafkopf, was incorrectly translated into English as "sheepshead". The old German word for barrel is "schaff". Putting together "schaff"
            | and "kopf" would literally mean "barrel head", referring to the practice of playing the game on the head of a beer barrel.
